        <p>â€‹I have been making games for about a year now and haven't been very focused on making money. It's mainly been a hobby and a "if I get donations, hey that cool, but I don't expect that" kind of thing. I am currently working on my 14th game which I will be selling for an amount, so before that I would like to make a breakdown of how much I have made.</p>
        <p><h2>So, not to waste your time, I have made $78.36 net, which includes $33.24 from Itch, $32.92 Ko-Fi, and $12.20 Patreon donations as of writing this article.</h2></p>
        <p>Here's is the breakdown for each game I have made:</p>

        <img src="images/money.png" alt="my full list of analytics on itch.io" title="my full list of analytics on itch.io">
        <a><em>my full list of analytics on itch.io</em></a>
        <br>
        
        <p>What can we learn from this?</p>
        <p>If you keep working on something you are passionate about and of a niche catches on, they are willing to fuel your passionate.</p>
